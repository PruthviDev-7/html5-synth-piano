# 🎹 Smooth Synth Piano

A lightweight, zero-latency piano built entirely with **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**. 

There are no external audio files (MP3/WAV) — every sound is synthesized in real-time using the **Web Audio API** for an incredibly smooth experience.

* **Polyphonic:** Play multiple keys at once.
* **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop (mouse/keyboard) and mobile (touch).
